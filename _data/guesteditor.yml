  description: In this study, we propose a novel multi-view bidirectional spatiotemporal graph network called Multi-BiSTGN to impute urban traffic data with complex missing patterns.The proposed model was validated on real-world traffic datasets collected in Wuhan, China. Experimental results showed that Multi-BiSTGN outperformed ten existing baselines under different missing types (random missing, block missing, and mixed missing) and missing rates.
